I'm supposed to be writing a big ol' thesis at the moment, which involves the minor tedium of collecting citation data into BibTeX. Naturally this is a great opportunity to stop doing everything important and start a project to automate the process :)

I hacked together [a tool](https://github.com/chnn/mathbib) that works like this:

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/3jk2SzOVZgSrinv9M7oUsodNw.js" id="asciicast-3jk2SzOVZgSrinv9M7oUsodNw" async></script>

I'm mostly excited about this since it is my first project written in Rust. The experience was more productive than I anticipated, largely due to the healthy Cargo-based ecosystem in Rust-land. After reading the first few chapters of [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), it was easy to wire up some plumbing between [various crates](https://github.com/chnn/mathbib/blob/6abbc95848b5a80b932eb4e6a74f3f6fa8eaa43a/Cargo.toml#L7-L13) to get a working prototype very rapidly. 

I did receive lots of bewildering feedback from the compiler along the way, which is a nice way to work (much better than bewildering feedback during runtime!) For the most part though, I haven't had to deal with ownership trickiness as much as I expected. I think questions of ownership are not as complicated for a small program like this one. I was also pleasantly surprised to find how ergonomic and comprehensive error handling is in Rustâ€”it's perhaps my favorite aspect of the language so far. Kinda like error handling in Go, except it feels less ad-hoc.

I plan to work on this project a little more. I want to make the code more idiomatic, and perhaps make the tool pluggable next for multiple citation databases.
