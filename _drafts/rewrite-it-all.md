title: When in doubt, rewrite
layout: post

There's a [well-known article](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/) that argues one should never rewrite a software project.
I have always struggled to respect this approach, because I really _like_ rewriting projectsâ€”or at least substantial portions of them.

My preferences are driven by a few axiomatic beliefs:

1. Writing code is easy
2. Modifying existing code is hard
3. Incidental complexity is rampant
4. Necessary complexity is rare
