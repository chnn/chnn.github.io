title: Bind Backbone data to the DOM with d3
---

[D3.js](http://d3js.org/)'s flexibility and wide scope of applications make it very fun library to work with. Whether you're looking for a specific technique or just want to see something cool, the [examples gallery](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery) is a fairly inexhaustible resource. It's hard to find an example, however, that shows D3 in the context of a JavaScript application (e.g. a Backbone single page app, or whatever you call it.) 

Because [Backbone View's](http://backbonejs.org/#View) are a relatively simple and lightweight abstraction, integrating D3 is fairly straightforward. The following are just some notes and suggestions on integrating D3 into a Backbone View. 

### Mike Bostock's reusable charts

### The visualization as a view property

* Private notation
* Short name

### Scope selections


* Scope selections
* Separate render and update
* d3 enter update pattern
