## About

Hi, my name is Chris Henn. I'm from Marin County (just north of San Francisco), and some things I like include writing code, cooking, electronic music, climbing and working out.

Currently I'm at the University of Washington in Seattle, studying computer science. I work at a [fantastic company](http://h2ometrics.com/) doing mostly front-end development (JavaScript and such.)

I write here for a few reasons:

* It's a fantastic way to learn
* To get better at writing
* Most of what I know comes from other people's sites, so I like to contribute

This site is generated using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and is served by [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=1e64afc35633) (there's a ref code in that link.) It lives in a Git repository available [here](https://github.com/chenn/writing).

You can contact me at chris@chrishenn.net. You can also stalk my [GitHub account](https://github.com/chenn).
