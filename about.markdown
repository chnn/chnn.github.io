  <p>Hello, my name is Chris Henn. I'm currently study mathematics at Reed College. Previously I've worked at <a href="http://www.tilde.io/">Tilde</a> and <a href="http://www.h2ometrics.com/">H2Ometrics</a>, focusing primarily on complex data visualization problems. I'll be looking for work come Fall 2017; if you have openings in software engineering, please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:chris@chrishenn.net">get in touch</a>.</p>
  <p>This site lives in a Git repository <a href="https://github.com/chnn/chnn.github.io">here</a>. I'm also on <a href="https://github.com/chnn">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chnnnnnnnnnnnn/">Instagram</a>.</p>
