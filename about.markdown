## About

Hi, my name is Chris Henn. I'm from Marin county, and currently attend Reed College in Portland. I like coding, food, music, and climbing.

I work at a [H2Ometrics](http://www.h2ometrics.com/) doing mostly front-end development (JavaScript, Ember, and such).

This site is generated using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and is served by [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=1e64afc35633) (there's a ref code in that link). It lives in a Git repository available [here](https://github.com/chenn/writing).

You can contact me at chris@chrishenn.net. I'm also on [GitHub](https://github.com/chnn).
