Hello, I'm Christopher Henn. I work as a programmer at [Stripe] (previously [InfluxData][influx], [Tilde][tilde], [H2Ometrics][h2ometrics]). I also recently graduated from Reed College with a degree in mathematics.

When I'm not attempting to befriend a computer, I can usually be found trail running. Find me elsewhere in cyberspace on [GitHub][github] or [Strava][strava].
