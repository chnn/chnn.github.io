Hello, my name is Chris Henn. I work at [InfluxData][influx], primarily on the [Chronograf][chronograf] data visualization tool. Previously I worked as a full-stack engineer at [Tilde][tilde] and [H2Ometrics][h2ometrics]. I also recently graduated from Reed College with a degree in mathematics.

When I'm not attempting to befriend a computer, I can usually be found trail running or mountaineering. Find me elsewhere in cyberspace on [GitHub][github] or [Strava][strava].
